# Changelog

All notable changes to the workspace-qdrant-mcp project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`workspace_index` action `sync_current_branch`** — TypeScript-native MCP action that receives git state from a host-side hook (branch, commit, worktree flag, remote) and forwards a `RegisterProject` gRPC call to the daemon with `register_if_new=true`. Implemented in the MCP server, so it works inside the dockerized container without requiring PowerShell on the host or `git` inside the container. Best-effort local `getGitState(repoDir)` fills in any field the hook did not pass.
- **POSIX shell git hooks** (`scripts/git-hooks/`) — `wqm-sync-branch.sh` detects git state via the shared `scripts/lib/path-resolver.sh` and POSTs to the MCP HTTP endpoint after every branch-affecting git operation. Companion `install.sh` writes the five hook stubs into `<git-common-dir>/hooks/` and respects existing non-WQM hooks. Cross-platform (Linux/macOS/Git Bash) counterpart to `scripts/windows/indexed-projects-hooks.ps1`.
- **`scripts/lib/path-resolver.sh`** and **`scripts/windows/lib/path-resolver.ps1`** — shared git/path detection helpers (repo root, worktree detection, common-dir resolution, current branch, head commit, remote URL, aggregate `git_state`). One-to-one with `wqm_common::paths` (Rust) and `src/typescript/mcp-server/src/utils/git-utils.ts` (TS).
- **Cross-language path fixtures** (`tests/path-fixtures/cases.json`) — single source of truth for canonical-path normalization. Loaded by both the Rust test runner (`src/rust/common/tests/cross_lang_path_fixtures.rs`) and the sh runner (`tests/path-fixtures/run-sh.sh`). 34 cases across normalize / normalize-errors / `is_windows_absolute` / `is_absolute` / `normalize_slashes`.
- **Windows drive paths accepted in `CanonicalPath`** — `C:/Users/...` and `C:\Users\...` are now valid canonical absolute paths, normalized to `C:/...`. Previously rejected as `RelativeInput`, which broke every code path that fed Windows host paths through the daemon. The same parser now lives in TS (`common/paths.ts`) and the cross-language fixtures cover both POSIX and Windows forms.
- **`SessionState.currentBranch` + lazy refresh** — the MCP server caches the current git branch on the session and refreshes it lazily (5s TTL) before every tool dispatch. `search` and `grep` use it as the default `branch` filter when the agent omits one; pass `branch: "*"` to opt out. Closes the gap where branch switches mid-session were ignored by the search layer.
- **TypeScript git helpers** (`utils/git-utils.ts`) — `isWorktree`, `getGitCommonDir`, `getCurrentBranch`, `getHeadCommit`, aggregate `getGitState`. Consumed by the `sync_current_branch` MCP action and the session lifecycle.
- **Path abstraction system (spec 16)** — type-system-enforced root/relative path discipline for host/Docker deployment parity. `CanonicalPath` for root paths (watch folders, project roots), `RelativePath` for content paths (files under a root). All paths stored relative to their watch folder root; absolute paths reconstructed via FK join at query time.
- **RelativePath newtype** (`wqm-common::paths`) — validates relative paths (rejects absolute, `..` segments, embedded NUL), serde-transparent for wire compatibility.
- **Schema v37 migration** — drops denormalized `file_path` columns from `tracked_files`, truncates ingest tables, implements crash-safe 4-phase migration protocol with `relative_path_migration_in_progress` marker table.
- **Post-startup migration hook** — after file watchers start, detects in-progress migration, truncates Qdrant ingest collections (with retry), waits for queue drain, and finalizes migration.
- **gRPC path validation macros** — `extract_canonical_path!`, `extract_relative_path!`, `extract_relative_paths!` for handler-entry validation. All path-accepting handlers now validate at entry with `InvalidArgument` on bad input.
- **CLI migration banner** — `wqm status health` shows progress banner during relative-path migration with percentage complete.
- **Zero-byte file handling** — empty files are recorded in tracked_files for inventory (chunk_count=0, Skipped status) without hitting the embedding pipeline.
- **Migration crash-recovery tests** — 9 integration tests simulating crashes at each phase boundary of the v37 migration.
- **Unified `DaemonConfig::validate()`** — chains every subconfig validator (queue_processor, monitoring, git, observability, embedding, lsp, grammars, updates, resource_limits, startup, daemon_endpoint, ingestion_limits, auto_ingestion). Errors are prefixed with the subsystem name for quick diagnosis. Called in `main.rs` immediately after `load_config`; invalid config causes non-zero exit before the daemon starts. (F-047)
- **`IngestionLimits` and `AutoIngestion` validators** — bounds checks for per-extension size limits and auto-ingestion settings, now wired into the unified validation chain. (F-047)
- **Cross-process single-instance lock for memexd (spec 16 §10.1, T9)** — memexd now binds a TCP listener to `127.0.0.1:7799` at startup, before opening SQLite. A second memexd (host or docker) attempting to start refuses with an actionable error mentioning the port and the `--control-port` override. Process death releases the bind immediately; no stale-lock cleanup needed. A diagnostic JSON identity stamp (`mode`, `pid`, `started_at`, `port`) is written to `~/.local/share/workspace-qdrant/memexd.lock` (host) or `/var/lib/wqm/memexd.lock` (docker) — best-effort, the socket is authoritative. Port resolution precedence: `--control-port` CLI flag > `WQM_CONTROL_PORT` env > `DaemonConfig.control_port` > built-in 7799. New `control_port: Option<u16>` field on `DaemonConfig` (defaults to `None` ⇒ 7799).
- **Schema migration v35 atomicity** — v35 table rebuild now runs inside `BEGIN IMMEDIATE … COMMIT / ROLLBACK`, with a `ForeignKeysGuard` RAII wrapper that restores `PRAGMA foreign_keys` on error. Prevents partial DDL state on crash mid-migration. (F-046)

### Changed

- **BREAKING: Schema v37** — first startup after upgrade triggers a wipe-and-rebuild of all ingested data (tracked_files, qdrant_chunks, unified_queue). Re-ingestion runs automatically; large repos may take 30+ minutes. Monitor via `wqm status health` banner.
- **BREAKING: File paths stored as relative** — `tracked_files` no longer has a `file_path` column; paths are stored as `relative_path` anchored to the watch folder root. Queries that previously used absolute file paths must join through `watch_folders.path`.
- **Proto field annotations** — all path fields in `workspace_daemon.proto` annotated with `[canonical]`, `[relative]`, or `[non-path]` comments.
- **Search cache-miss result cap** — exact-search cache misses previously ran with `max_results: usize::MAX`, streaming every matching FTS row into memory. Cache misses are now capped at a bounded limit and context lines are attached without re-executing the full search. (F-028, F-029)
- **TypeScript CI** — `better-sqlite3` is rebuilt against the active Node.js ABI, and unit and integration tests run as separate steps to surface failures more precisely.
- **Dependabot coverage expanded** — now covers the full Cargo workspace (daemon, CLI, common, grpc, memexd) in addition to the existing npm scope.
- **Docker base images pinned by SHA256** — `node:20-slim` base images in all Dockerfiles are now pinned to a specific digest rather than a floating tag. (supply chain hardening)
- **fastembed patch annotated; checksum enforced** — the fastembed Cargo patch entry carries a comment explaining the override, and the download-install scripts now fail-closed when a checksum is absent or mismatched.

### Fixed

- **TS `isGitRepository` rejected worktrees** — required `.git` to be a directory; linked worktrees (where `.git` is a file pointing to the main repo's git dir) returned `false`. Now accepts either form via `existsSync`. (Audit Bug 4)
- **TS `getGitRemoteUrl` couldn't follow worktrees** — read `<repo>/.git/config` directly, so linked worktrees (no `config` under the `.git` file) returned `null`. Switched to `git -C <repo> config --get remote.origin.url`, which follows the gitdir indirection automatically. (Audit Bug 5)
- **MCP session auto-registered system directories** — when the MCP server was spawned with a system cwd (`C:\WINDOWS\system32`, `/`, `/usr`, etc.), session start walked up looking for a project marker, found none, and registered the cwd or one of its ancestors. Now guards against a curated set of suspicious roots and supports `WQM_PROJECT_ROOT` env override. (Audit Bug 3)
- **`registerProject(register_if_new=true)` misclassified worktrees as new projects** — the daemon's `determine_registration_action` skipped worktree detection on the `register_if_new=true` path AND on the existing-project path, so a worktree of an already-registered repo was either enqueued as a duplicate project or simply reactivated the parent. `try_worktree_auto_register` now runs first regardless of `register_if_new` or `project_exists`. (Audit Bug 6)
- **`register_session`'s ignored `_branch` arg looked like a real git ref** — call sites passed `"main"`, which was easy to misread as touching the `main` branch. Renamed the parameter to `_session_tag` and updated callers to pass `"session"`. Behavior unchanged (the value was never used).
- **Search filter dropped on >500 base-points** — the fallback code path that disabled base-point filtering and broadened to all-tenant results when a project had more than 500 active base-points now falls back to the primary base-point instead of dropping the filter entirely. (F-012)
- **FTS position-aware sequence assignment** — `diff_apply` previously appended all middle-of-file insertions after `MAX(seq)`, causing incorrect FTS line ordering. Sequences are now assigned at the correct target index. (F-018)
- **Project path canonicalization on registration** — project roots are now canonicalized and validated to exist before enqueueing; relative paths, symlinks, and nonexistent paths are rejected at registration time rather than producing silent failures. (F-019)
- **Queue re-lease on memory pressure** — under memory pressure, the queue processor previously re-leased only the current item and left the rest of the batch stuck `in_progress` until lease expiry. All remaining batch items are now re-leased together. (F-044)
- **FastEmbed init panic replaced with gRPC error** — the `.expect()` call in the gRPC embedding service is replaced with a controlled error response; a missing or undownloadable model now returns a gRPC status rather than crashing the service. (F-048)
- **`cleanupSession` double-invocation** — `cleanupSession` now carries an idempotence flag so that the `onclose` and `stop()` paths cannot both fire `recordSessionEnd()`, preventing metrics from being decremented twice. (F-049)
- **`max_retries` column removed from queue schema** — stale `max_retries` column removed from `CREATE_UNIFIED_QUEUE_SQL` and all migration copies, eliminating schema/code drift.
- **`--allow-default` env-var override gap** — when `--allow-default` triggered a fallback to built-in defaults, `apply_env_overrides` was not called on the fallback config. `OTEL_*` and `WQM_PROMETHEUS_*` env vars are now applied on both the normal and fallback paths.

### Security

- **`download-install.ps1` fails closed on missing checksum** — the PowerShell installer now aborts instead of continuing when a checksum file is absent or does not match. (supply chain hardening, T20-closeout)
- **ONNX Runtime version-bump CI gate** — the scheduled ONNX Runtime version-bump workflow now runs the full build-and-test matrix before committing the version change, preventing a broken version from landing. (T20-closeout)
- **Security advisory exemption table** — `security.yml` now contains a documented exemption table for known low-risk advisories, making audit decisions explicit and reviewable. (T20-closeout)
- **Provenance / SBOM preservation markers** — `docker-publish.yml` attestation steps carry `F-P2` markers to preserve SLSA provenance and SBOM generation through future edits.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Docker images** — published to Docker Hub and GHCR for `memexd` (Rust daemon) and `workspace-qdrant-mcp` (TypeScript MCP server), multi-arch `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`.
- **Three deployment bundles** under `docker/compose/`:
  - `minimal.yml` — memexd + MCP against an external Qdrant
  - `full-stack.yml` — attaches to the user's existing main-docker stack
  - `standalone-memexd.yml` / `standalone-mcp.yml` — single-service deployments
  - `observability.yml` — self-contained Prometheus + Grafana + OpenTelemetry collector overlay
- **Telemetry pipeline**:
  - MCP server instrumented with `prom-client` — exports `wqm_mcp_tool_invocations_total`, `wqm_mcp_tool_duration_seconds`, `wqm_mcp_session_count`, `wqm_mcp_daemon_fallback_total`, `wqm_mcp_cache_{hits,misses}_total`.
  - HTTP `/metrics` endpoint on port 9092 when `MCP_SERVER_MODE=http`.
  - OTLP push export on session end in stdio mode (1s fire-and-forget).
  - New daemon gauge `wqm_queue_oldest_pending_age_seconds` driving the QueueStuck alert.
- **Prometheus alerting rules** (`docker/prometheus/alerts.yml`) — 6 rules covering queue health (QueueStuck, QueueFailedWarning, QueueFailedCritical), daemon/qdrant availability (DaemonDown, QdrantUnreachable), and MCP session idleness (MCPNoInvocations).
- **Four Grafana dashboards** auto-provisioned under `Workspace`: claude-mcp, qdrant, memexd, system-overview.
- **Deployment documentation** under `docker/docs/` — README + minimal / full-stack / standalone / telemetry / dashboards guides.
- **`wqm service` DaemonSource awareness** — `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `status` now detect whether the daemon runs locally, in Docker, both, remotely, or not at all, and branch behaviour accordingly.
- **CI workflows** — `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` (tag-triggered multi-arch publish to Docker Hub + GHCR), `docker-test.yml` (pre-publish smoke test), `docker-integration.yml` (full-stack e2e).

### Changed

  - Use `unified_queue` table instead
  - Will be removed in v0.5.0
  - See [MIGRATION.md](docs/MIGRATION.md#queue-migration-guide-legacy--unified-queue-v040)
- **SQLiteQueueClient** - This class is deprecated
  - Use `SQLiteStateManager.enqueue_unified()` instead
  - Runtime `DeprecationWarning` emitted on instantiation
  - Will be removed in v0.5.0

  - Only enable for migration compatibility
  - Will be removed in v0.5.0

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed

#### Critical: Processing Pipeline Memory Leak
- **Dynamic grammar memory leak** — Using cached `.dylib` grammars for languages with
  static support (Python, Rust, TypeScript, etc.) caused ~270MB/s memory growth in the
  tree-sitter parser due to ABI mismatches. The daemon now prefers statically compiled
  grammars and only falls back to dynamic grammars for languages without built-in support.
  Before: RSS 85MB to 2.4GB in 10 seconds, 0 items completed.
  After: RSS stable at ~620MB, 100+ items processed per minute.
- **macOS memory pressure detection** — Replaced `sysinfo` `used_memory()` (which
  reports compressor pages as used on macOS, showing ~84% usage on idle 64GB systems)
  with `kern.memorystatus_level` sysctl for accurate available-memory reporting.
- **Process RSS safety valve** — Added per-process RSS check (2GB default) using
  `mach task_info` on macOS / `/proc/self/statm` on Linux. Fires at loop top and
  between batch items to prevent runaway memory growth.
- **Qdrant readiness wait** — Added exponential-backoff gRPC readiness wait at startup
  (up to ~90s) to prevent circuit breaker from tripping when memexd starts before
  Qdrant on system boot.
- **sysinfo allocation leak** — Replaced per-poll `System::new()` allocation with
  `thread_local!` reuse in the sysinfo fallback path.

### Added

#### CLI UX Overhaul
- **Interactive TUI dashboard** — New `wqm tui` command with a 2x4 interactive grid
  showing service status, queue stats, projects, libraries, graph, config, languages,
  and recent activity. Each cell supports popup detail views.
- **TUI browsers** — Project browser, library browser, and queue browser with
  filtering, scrolling, and detail popups.
- **Output design system** — Standardized CLI output with borderless tables, consistent
  key-value formatting, path shortening (`~/` for home), 8-char hash/UUID truncation,
  section headers, and summary count footers.
- **Contextual empty states** — Commands that return no results now display helpful
  messages with suggested next actions.
- **Queue list improvements** — Added project name, subject, and error columns; `--all`
  flag to override default pagination; rich detail view for `queue show`.

### Changed
- **CLI renamed to Companion** — `wqm-cli` description updated, help styling improved,
  `init completions` and `init man` commands flattened under `init` namespace.
- **Command hierarchy reorganized** — `watch` moved under `project`, `collections` under
  `admin`, `backup`/`restore` under `admin`, `man`/`hooks` under `init`.
- **Consistent output formatting** — All commands converted from bordered tables to the
  new clean borderless style with dots for path indicators and dynamic separator widths.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-01-19

### Added

#### Unified Multi-Tenant Collection Architecture
- **Single `_projects` Collection** - ALL project content now stored in one unified collection with tenant isolation via `tenant_id` payload field (12-char hex derived from normalized git remote URL or path hash). See [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#collection-structure) for details.
- **Single `_libraries` Collection** - ALL library documentation now stored in one unified collection with tenant isolation via `library_name` payload field
- **Payload Indexing** - O(1) filtering performance via indexed payload fields on `tenant_id` and `library_name`
- **Hard Tenant Isolation** - Queries automatically filter by tenant_id, preventing cross-tenant data leakage
- **Cross-Project Search** - Search across all projects with `scope="all"` parameter
- **Library Inclusion** - Include library documentation in searches with `include_libraries=True` parameter

#### Session Lifecycle Management (ProjectService gRPC)
- **RegisterProject RPC** - Register project for high-priority processing when MCP server starts. See [GRPC_API.md](docs/GRPC_API.md#registerproject) for usage.
- **DeprioritizeProject RPC** - Decrement session count when MCP server stops gracefully
- **Heartbeat RPC** - Keep session alive with 30-second intervals (60-second timeout)
- **GetProjectStatus RPC** - Query current project status, priority, and session count
- **ListProjects RPC** - List all registered projects with priority and active-only filtering
- **Priority-Based Processing** - Active sessions get HIGH priority (queue position 1), inactive get NORMAL (position 5)
- **Automatic Project Registration** - MCP server automatically registers project on startup, daemon begins watching immediately
- **Orphaned Session Detection** - Sessions missing heartbeat for 60 seconds marked orphaned, cleaned up periodically
- **Session Revival** - New MCP connections can revive orphaned projects without re-registration. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#session-lifecycle-management) for state machine diagram.

#### Search Enhancements
- **`scope` Parameter** - Control search scope: `"project"` (current project only, default), `"global"` (global collections), `"all"` (all projects). See [API.md](API.md#search) for examples.
- **`include_libraries` Parameter** - Include `_libraries` collection in search results
- **`branch` Parameter** - Filter results by git branch (supports `"*"` for all branches)
- **`collections_searched` Response Field** - Lists collections that were searched
- **Metadata-Based Multi-Project Filtering** - Use `tenant_id` in filter conditions for advanced queries

#### Documentation
- **[docs/GRPC_API.md](docs/GRPC_API.md)** - Comprehensive gRPC API reference documenting all 4 services (20 RPCs): SystemService, CollectionService, DocumentService, ProjectService
- **[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Updated with session lifecycle management section including state machine and sequence diagrams
- **[API.md](API.md)** - Updated MCP tools reference with multi-tenant search examples
- **[CLI.md](CLI.md)** - Updated CLI reference with unified collection commands
- **[MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md)** - Migration guide from v0.3.x to v0.4.0 unified model

### Changed

#### Breaking Changes

**Collection Architecture (MAJOR)**
- **Unified `_projects` Collection** replaces per-project `_{project_id}` collections
  - All project documents now stored in single collection with `tenant_id` payload field
  - Previous: One collection per project (e.g., `_abc123def456`, `_789xyz012abc`)
  - New: Single `_projects` collection with tenant isolation via payload filtering
- **Unified `_libraries` Collection** replaces per-library `_{library_name}` collections
  - All library documents now stored in single collection with `library_name` payload field
  - Previous: One collection per library (e.g., `_fastapi`, `_react`)
  - New: Single `_libraries` collection with library isolation via payload filtering
- **Only 4 Collection Types** - System now uses exactly 4 collection types:
  1. `_projects` - Unified collection for ALL project content
  2. `_libraries` - Unified collection for ALL library documentation
  3. `{user}-{type}` - User collections (e.g., `work-notes`, `myapp-scratchbook`)
  4. `_memory`, `_agent_memory` - System and agent memory rules

**Search API Changes**
- **Default scope is `"project"`** - Searches current project only by default (previously searched all content)
- **`include_libraries` required** - Libraries not included unless explicitly requested
- **Response format updated** - Now includes `tenant_id` and `collections_searched` fields

**Configuration**
- Collection naming constants updated:
  - `UNIFIED_PROJECTS_COLLECTION = "_projects"`
  - `UNIFIED_LIBRARIES_COLLECTION = "_libraries"`

### Migration

**Automatic Migration Available**
```bash
# Preview migration (dry run)
wqm admin migrate-to-unified --dry-run

# Execute migration
wqm admin migrate-to-unified

# Verify migration
wqm admin collections --verbose
```

**Migration Process:**
1. Creates `_projects` and `_libraries` collections if not exist
2. Copies documents from old `_{project_id}` collections to `_projects`
3. Adds `tenant_id` metadata to each document
4. Copies documents from old `_{library_name}` collections to `_libraries`
5. Adds `library_name` metadata to each document
6. Optionally deletes old collections after verification

**Search Migration:**
```python
# Old behavior (v0.3.x)
search(query="authentication")  # Searched all content

# New behavior (v0.4.0)
search(query="authentication")                              # Current project only
search(query="authentication", scope="all")                 # All projects
search(query="authentication", include_libraries=True)      # Current project + libraries
search(query="authentication", scope="all", include_libraries=True)  # Everything
```

### Benefits of Unified Model

- **Scalability** - Supports thousands of projects without collection sprawl
- **Efficiency** - Single HNSW index per collection type (better memory utilization)
- **Cross-Project Discovery** - Semantic search across all projects with one query
- **Simpler Operations** - Fewer collections to manage and monitor
- **Better Isolation** - Hard tenant filtering prevents data leakage
