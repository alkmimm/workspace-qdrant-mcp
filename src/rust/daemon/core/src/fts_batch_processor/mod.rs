//! Adaptive Batch Processor for FTS5 Code Lines Updates (Task 51)
//!
//! Monitors the unified queue depth and switches between two processing modes:
//!
//! - **Single-file mode** (queue depth <= `burst_threshold`): Applies each file's
//!   line diff immediately, then rebuilds FTS5. Target latency: ~20ms per file.
//!
//! - **Batch mode** (queue depth > `burst_threshold`): Accumulates file changes
//!   in memory, then applies all diffs in a single transaction followed by one
//!   FTS5 rebuild. Throughput: ~95,000 lines/sec.
//!
//! Uses [`line_diff::compute_line_diff`] for change detection and
//! [`SearchDbManager`] for code_lines / FTS5 operations.
