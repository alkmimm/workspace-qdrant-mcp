/**
 * Seed the default global rule set, idempotently by label AND content.
 *
 * A fresh install gets all defaults; an install already holding some of them
 * gets only the missing ones backfilled. Two guards prevent duplicate rows:
 *  - by label: a default whose label already exists is skipped.
 *  - by content: a default whose trimmed content already exists is skipped too.
 *    This matters because a bulk import/restore (or an older, label-less seeder)
 *    can leave global rules WITHOUT a `label`; those are invisible to a
 *    label-only guard, so without the content check the seeder would re-add a
 *    labeled copy and create the exact duplicate pair this guard exists to
 *    prevent. If the list call fails we skip entirely — without the existing
 *    set we cannot dedup safely.
